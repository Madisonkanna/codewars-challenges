<h1 align="center">Coding Challenges</h1>

## Objective: Complete 50 coding challenges. 

This is an ongoing challenge in the [CodeBookClub](https://madisonkanna.com/codebookclub). If you'd like to join the challenge, sign up to the club and join the #CodeWars channel. Once there, you can post your solutions, suggest problems for us to work on, or ask questions if you get stuck on a problem. You can also fork this repo and add all of your solutions to these questions. Don't worry about joining the challenge late--feel free to join whenever.

## Feedback request.
Please feel free to make a PR on any code you see and add your constructive criticism, feedback or suggestions.
